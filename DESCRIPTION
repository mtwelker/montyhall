Description: This package replicates the Monty Hall problem
   based on the TV show "Let's Make a Deal" where there are
   three doors for a contestant to choose from, one of which
   has a car behind it and two have goats. The contestant selects
   a door, then the host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then
   the contestant is given an opportunity to stay with their
   original selection or switch to the other unopened door. There
   was a famous debate about whether it was optimal to stay or
   switch when given the option to switch, so this simulation was
   created to test both strategies.
